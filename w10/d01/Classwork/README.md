#Fakeout

> Make a small rails app that generates random users with Faker.

- The index should have a button that generates a random user when clicked and saves it to the database
- Store a user's name and email to the database
- Once a user is created, we should be redirected to the show route
- Define a method on the user's model that checks if the user is using gmail or not
- In the show view, distinguish between users using gmail and those that aren't
- Make sure there is a route to see all users as well
