## Fear of Commitment: Get Comfortable With Git and Github, review the Command Line, and Learn Markdown While You're At It!

####We spent some time talking about Git and Github today. We'll be using these tools extensively in class: to back up our work, to submit homework, and eventually for collaboration. It's important to get reps using git and github, so don't worry if the homework seems a bit repetitive.

####We are going to write tonight's homework in a language called "Markdown". Markdown is a popular language that allows us to quickly write text files that can be rendered as HTML. Markdown doesn't require us to wrap our content in tags, and is thus very quick and easy to write (and read!). Markdown is used to write readme files for projects on github, like this familiar one (scroll down to the readme file on the page):

####Briefly, our goals for tonight's homework are to:
* Get reps staging and committing files.
* Practice reading the documentation of a new language (markdown) in order to learn how to use it.
* Practice using Markdown to write easily readable guides and ReadMe files.
* Identify and catalog terminal commands that we will be using frequently throughout the class and in the world of programming.

###Step 1
* Install Atom
  - Mac users can use the command `brew cask install atom` in the Terminal.
  - Linux users can use the command `apt-get install Atom` in the Terminal.
* Atom is great for Markdown. While we prefer to use sublime text as our primary text editor in class (it's faster), Atom is great for writing markdown. Touch a markdown file (.md extension), and open it in Atom. Once your markdown file is open, hit `ctrl + shift + m` to view your updates live on the right side of your screen!

* Here is a link to a great 'cheatsheet' for markdown commands.

###Step 2

* Research the following command line programs:
  - `cat`
  - `echo`
  - `find`
  - `grep`
* Make a list of AT LEAST 15 command line commands that you found yourself using today. These can involve creating folders and directories, navigation, git and github, etc. You can format your list however you'd like. For each command you add to your list, stage and commit your changes, then push them to Github for practice!

###Step 3
* Try and create a table like the one found here:

###Step 4
* Think about how you first day went. If there's something you feel less comfortable with (command line, git, elements from the prework), then work on it! These fundamentals are crucial for building a good foundation to work from throughout the course.

**Throughout all this, and going forward, try and limit the use of your mouse. Take advantage of `cmd + tab` to quickly navigate between programs. **

###Step 5
**Bonus**
- See if you can use the `cat` and `echo` commands to write a line of text to a file from the command line, then send the text from that file to another file...
