## Question 1

```javascript
var a = 5
var b = 4
a = b
```

At the end of this program, what are the values of a and b? Try to explain, in plain English, how you got your answer for each one.

```
The value of a is 5 and for b is 4. A has been given a new value of 4 since it equals to the value of b.

var e = 3
var f = 9
var g = e + f
var f === g
var e = 3
```

At the end of this program, what are the values of e, f, and g? Try to explain, in plain English, how you got your answer for each one.

```
The values of e is 3, f and g are both 12. E equals 3 and f equals 9. G equals e(3) + f(9) which is 12. f is given the new value of 12 as well as g since they are both equal to each other.
