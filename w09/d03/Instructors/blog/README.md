#A MicroBlog with the PG gem

- Use the PG gem to expand upon the blog from yesterday. Try an implement as many CRUD features as you can.

- Don't forget about method override!

- Use binding.pry liberally!

- Sinatra gives us an object called `params` that collects all types of user input in a nice basket, from queries, from dynamic urls, and from the body of post requests.

- Remember, SQL uses single quotes!
