# Turtle Power!

**Part 1**

Write a `NinjaTurtle` class that will contain the following information about the Ninja Turtles:
name, color, weapon. Be sure to also write getter methods so that you can access all attributes on `NinjaTurtle`.

For reference:

Leonardo
- blue, ninjato, Leonardo da Vinci, true

Michelangelo
- orange, nunchucks, Michelangelo Buonarroti, true

Raphael
- red, sai, Raffaello Sanzio da Urbino, true

Donatello
- purple, bo, Donato di Niccolo di Betto Bardi, true

Test the class to make sure you can create instances of it and that the getter methods work.

**Part 2**

Give the class a `info` method that dynamically outputs a string like the below:

`Leonardo wears a blue bandana and his weapon is ninjato.`

**Part 3**

Create an instance of the `NinjaTurtle` class for each Ninja Turtle character and put the instances in an array.

Iterate through the array and call the method you created in part 2 on each of the instances.
