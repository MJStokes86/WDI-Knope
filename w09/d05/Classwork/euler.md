## Project Euler

Solving puzzles is a great way to keep your coding skills sharp, and [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) is one of the best tools for doing so.


#### Directions

1. [Create an account at Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/register).
1. Create a directory called `project_euler` __outside of your guildenstern directory__.
1. cd into your `project_euler` directory and initialize it as a git repo via `git init`
1. Create a repository on github called 'project_euler'
1. Grab the ssh key from that repository (not https!) and within the repository on your computer, type `git remote add origin COPYSSHKEY`
1. Within your repo, create a file `question_01.rb` and [solve this problem](https://projecteuler.net/problem=1).
1. Submit your answer to Project Euler. If it's correct, move on to the next problem.
If it isn't, keep trying.
