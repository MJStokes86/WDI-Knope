#Animal Farm
> Mr. Jones is a  farmer with a burgeoning flock of livestock to tend to. His farm has grown to the point where he's having trouble keeping track of all the animals. He needs a simple, SQL-backed Command Line Application to keep organized.

###Client Needs
> Mr. Jones should have the ability to add animals to the database. He wants to track their breed(type? kind?), color, age and name. He wants to be able to see a full list of all his animals at any time. He also wants to be able to search his animals by their breed or age.

> Sometimes Father Time pays an unsuspecting visit to the farm. Mr. Jones should be able to remove animals from his database.


###Bonus

> Winter has come to the farm, and Mr. Jones has built a few barns to house the animals in. He wants to be able to add barns to his program as well, and wants to identify their capacity, color and name. He's having trouble keeping track of which animal is in what barn, so he'd like the program to be able to track that as well.
