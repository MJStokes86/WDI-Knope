#Food Violations

> The city of New York collects an incredible amount of data about everything, from subway stops to popular baby names. The data is available to the public through a great API, available <a href="https://nycopendata.socrata.com/data">here.</a>

> The city has released some of the results of a recent round of restaurant inspections. The API endpoint for that data is:

```
https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/xx67-kt59.json
```

Take some time to check out the data structure, and then write a simple command line application that allows users to query the data for restaurant information. You can build whatever functionality into the application that you want. Below are some ideas:

- Allow users to see the names of all restaurants reviewed in the data set.
- Allow users to enter a restaurant name and see any and all violations for that restaurant.
- Allow for users to display the names of all restaurants by a given cuisine description.
- Allow for users to display the names all restaurants in a given borough.
- Allow for users to display the address of all restaurants in a given borough with an "A" rating.
- Whatever else you want to build!
