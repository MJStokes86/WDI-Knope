#ExpressWeather Upgrade

Included in today's classwork directory is our weather app from yesterday. Add the following behavior:
- Get /breakdown/*city*/*state*
  - displays all 24 hours of a forecast as HTML using mustache templates.

**bonus**
- Refactor the app so that it uses a form allowing the user to enter a state and city and return a forecast.
