#Mustache Templates Exercise
Create a command line application (not a server!) that does the following and uses the data file in this directory. Use mustache to iterate through the data structure when necessary. The app should meet the following specs:


```bash
$ node blogs.js list
returns an HTML file that prints out all blog posts.

$ node blogs.js random
returns an HTML file containing a single random blog post
```
