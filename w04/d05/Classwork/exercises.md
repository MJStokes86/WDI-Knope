In todays `Classwork` folder, make a folder each for the following exercises.

##Dogr

###Part 1

Create 2 tables:

owners
- id
- name

dogs
- id
- name
- breed
- owner_id

Write a file that will fill both tables with multiple entries.

###Part 2

Write a command line application that will allow you enter an owners name and will output the names of all dogs owned by that person.

```bash
node dogr.js Steve
Spike
Molly
Jenkins
```

##Random People

###Part 1

Create 1 table:

users
- id
- gender
- full name
- state
- username
- email
- phone
- ssn
- picture

###Part 2

Write javascript code that steals data from the [RandomUser API](https://randomuser.me/) and fills the database with 25 users.

NOTE - you would never actually do this - this is just to practice the mechanics!

###Part 3

Write a CLI that allows you to return every user from a given state.

Example
```bash
node users.js NY
Jane Doe
John Doe
```
