# World Traveler

## Problem

Your client, Phileas Fogg, is planning a trip around the world. He needs a command line application to help him.

## Requirements

In a conversation with the client, he details the following:

> I imagine using this app in three ways:

> (1) I want to be able to plan my itinerary before I leave. For each stop I'd like to record the city, country, arrival date, and departure date. I want to be able to see the list of stops on my journey to remind myself of where I'm going.

> (2) While I am travelling. I plan to write journal entries during each part of my journey, so I need the app to be able to record those for me. I'd also like to be able to see the weather for any of my stops so that I can know what to expect.

> (3) After the trip, I'd like to be able to read my journal entries for a particular city.

## Instructions

1. Write a detailed feature spec!
2. Draw an ERD for your app. What tables are there, what columns should they have, and are there any relationships?
3. Build!

## Deliverables

In today's HW folder,

* A README with your feature spec
* A picture of your ERD
* Your application code

## Bonus

In a follow up conversation, Phileas says:

> It would also be nice, during the planning stage of my trip, to be able to see the planned duration of my entire trip in days. I would also like to see the total mileage of the trip.

A developer friend mentions the [Geolib](https://github.com/manuelbieh/Geolib) package may help you calculate distances.
