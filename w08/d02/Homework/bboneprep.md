> Tomorrow, we will begin learning Backbone.js, a powerful JavaScript library that allows us to structure single-page applications in an organized and extendible way.

> Tonight, we will be providing you with some sample code written, the bookie application from last week rewritten with Backbone.

> Before taking a look at the code, there is some reading you should do to give you some background on Backbone, how it works, and the problem it was designed to solve.

- Inside the guides folder, check out the Backbone-Fundamentals PDF we've added.
  - Everyone should read pages 11-30. Pages 33-84 would be helpful, but are optional.
- read Neel's quick Backbone overview <a href="https://github.com/ga-students/Knope/blob/master/guides/backbone_primer.md"> here</a>

> Now take a look at Jeff's Bookie code with Backbone. Try and read through it slowly, making comments along the way about your understanding of the code.

> Bear in mind that we are just 'dipping our mental toes' in the pool that is Backbone. We will be going into everything you look at tonight in detail over the next few days, so the purpose of tonight's reading is just an introduction. You shouldn't expect to be blazing through Backbone apps tomorrow.
