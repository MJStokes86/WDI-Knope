###The Mighty Ducks

> You've been provided with a server and database that stores the roster for the mighty ducks. Take a look at it to see what attributes are stored.

> The goal of the lab is to practice using Backbone to implement CRUD on a single resource. How you do this is up to you!

Your App should let a user:

- View all the Ducks
- View individual Ducks
- Delete Ducks
- Edit Ducks

Your App should use:

- Backbone Models
- Backbone Views
- Backbone Collections (for both models and views)


Bonus:

- Include a button that allows users to sort the ducks by position.
