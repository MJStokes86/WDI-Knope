#GitHubStalkers.io
- Create an app that takes a user's github name as input, and renders their github followers to the DOM.
  - Use Semantic-UI to create cards for each follower (or make your own cards)
  - use a library like <a href="http://interactjs.io/"> interact.js</a> to add interactivity to the cards.
    - try making them draggable (is that a word?)
    - try making it so they change size upon being clicked (what a great user experience!)
- Host it!

  > There isn't any starter code, so you'll need to put the framework of the app together yourself!
