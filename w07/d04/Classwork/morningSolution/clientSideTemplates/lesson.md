- client side templates. we so far, we've been using templates in the server. draw this out. Can we still do this with a single page application? draw out relationship.

- client-side templating is important. do with mustache. where does mustache come from then? cdn

- practice. try to make a function that takes two args (name, age) arguments and uses mustache to create HTML which you then render to the dom. this should work in the console.

- now let's look at a big template( semantic-ui cards) we could bring this into our main js file, but there is a better way

- show starter code being used FIRST as just stand in HTML. THen show how wrapping it in a script tag makes it disappear. Then sub in mustache.

- Finally, show that we can reference that script with jquery and the text function.
