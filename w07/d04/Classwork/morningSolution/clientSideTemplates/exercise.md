#RandomUsers/Templates

Make an app that

- Uses AJAX to grab a random user from the RandomUserGenerator API when a button is clicked.

- Use client-side templating to render the User as a semantic UI card. Make the Username and email unique.

- BONUS: Make the cards draggable with <a href="http://draggabilly.desandro.com/"> dragabilly</a>
