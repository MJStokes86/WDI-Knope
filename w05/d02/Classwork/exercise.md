#Simple Restful Applications

> We're going to work in groups to write RESTful HTTP APIs that can be 'consumed' by simple command-line applications.

> Servers should send JSON back as a response

> Each app will have two teams: one working on the interface (through the command line), and one working on the server(returning JSON and using Express). These groups should remain separate throughout the exercise. No slack!

> Remember, we can use the request library to make requests to HTTP APIs

> In each case, the databases have been set up and seeded for you.
