I want to model a diary as an object, and an entry as a separate object. Entries should have an author, title, and some content. A diary should be able to accept new entries. It should also have behavior to print out each entry. A diary should have separate behavior to print out all it's entries as nicely formatted HTML

BONUS:A Diary should also be able to cycle through and capitalize the first word in all titles.
