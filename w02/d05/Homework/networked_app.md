# Simple TCP App

> We've spent the past week creating simple command line apps accessible by a single user.
> We can now allow many users to connect to our apps!

### If you want a challenge...

Write an application that meets the following specs:
- Persists data to a file and retrieves it.
- Is accessible to multiple users via an IP address and port.
- Incorporates the concept of multiple users (why else use the internet?)
  - If your app stores diary entries, for example, then each entry should have a user associated with it. Users should be able to access their own data.
  - Don't worry about passwords or any kind of security.
- **These are basic guidelines that you must meet, but feel free to get creative with your idea and scope!**

### If you're looking for more structure...

Expand on the idea of the **task list app** that you worked on on Wednesday.
- Make the application networked and accessible via an IP address and port.
- Make sure that your app 'persists' or stores data to a file, and retrieves that same data structure.
- Incorporate the concept of a user for each task that you create.
  - For example, you could model the user list to apply to a family, and each task could be associated with Mom, Dad, Brother or Sister.
  - Users should be able to retrieve tasks specific to a certain user.
**Remember, this is a guideline, make your app as robust as you're comfortable with!**

**IN BOTH CASES**
> Be sure to spec out your application by clearly defining your set of features. Don't rush into coding your app; you have the whole weekend for this, so take ample time to spec it out!
