- Work in pairs.
- Each of you will play the role of both a client and a developer.
- Initially, each of you should take 15 minutes in the role of a client and come up with a very simple concept for a command line application, in line with the scope of the Movie Haus.
  - Make sure to have this saved in a file for your partner (you can also just slack it to them)
- After 15 minutes, exchange your ideas, and each of you should then take the role of the developer, taking another 15 or 20 minutes to write out features for the application.
  - Try and format your work in an easily readable way, and include examples of how the program should work.
