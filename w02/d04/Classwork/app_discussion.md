#Questions to ask:

**remember: we need to become comfortable when talking about code**

**try to ask and answer each of these questions**

- what was the premise for your app?
- what does your spec look like?
  - how did the features you wrote out inform the development of your app?
- how did you structure your data? Why?
  - did you write JSON files? What did that allow you to do?
- what did you struggle with?
- what do you feel that you learned?
- what surprised you about building your app?
- is there something you wish that you had done differently?
- are there features that you didn't build?
  - because of time? or because you're not sure how yet?
