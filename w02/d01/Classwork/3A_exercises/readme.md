### Math is fun

1. Add
  - Create a command line application called `add.js` that will take 2 numbers as arguments and will output their sum.
- Subtract
  - Create a command line application called `subtract.js` that will take 2 numbers as arguments and will output their difference.
- Multiplication  
  - Create a command line application called `multiply.js` that will take 2 numbers as arguments and will output their product.
- Division
  - Create a command line application called `division.js` that will take 2 numbers as arguments and will output their quotient.

### The Weekend

Write a command line program that:
  - takes a day of the week as an argument (lowercase)
  - prints to the terminal ```weekend``` or ```weekday``` depending on whether that day lies on the weekend

  
### The Telephone

Write a command line program that:
  - takes a phone number as an argument
  - prints ```valid``` or ```invalid``` depending on whether it is the right amount of digits
  - *Assume no dashes, paranthesis, or initial ```1``` for out-of-area calls e.g. ```8004441111```*


### Iteration One

Given the following array of arrays: 


```javascript
[ 
  ["Squirtle",["HP",[44,["Attack",[48,["Defense",[65,["Speed",[43]]]]]]]]], 
  ["Snorlax",["HP",[160,["Attack",[110,["Defense",[65,["Speed",[30]]]]]]]]], 
  ["Mew",["HP",[100,["Attack",[100,["Defense",[100,["Speed",[100]]]]]]]]]
]
```
Using iteration, console log each pokemon's info in the below format:

```
Squirtle || HP: 44 || Attack: 48 || Defense: 65 || Speed: 43
```
