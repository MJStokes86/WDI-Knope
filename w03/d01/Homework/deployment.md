#Deployment
> Today, we walked through the process of deploying a simple TCP app to a 'droplet' on Digital Ocean. This allows us to open our applications up to users everywhere (as long as they have a basic knowledge of the command line and TelNet)

###Tonight
- The goal of tonight's Lab is to become familiar with the process of deployment and deploying working code to a 'production environment' (your DO droplet, in this case)


####If your app from this weekend is working...
  - Choose one or two new features to implement tonight. As you add them, test the code locally (your development environment) before deploying it to your production environment.
    - Be sure to carefully break down the process of deploying code. There are a few steps involved.
  - If you're feeling content with the features you've got, take some time to refactor your code.
    - Try implementing switch statements to clean up control flow.
    - Wrap behavior into functions for better organization.
    - Make sure your code is properly indented,etc. As this code will be existing outside of our private class repo, it will be publically available to anyone (aka employers).

####If your app from this weekend isn't working yet...
  - Get it working! Sean is here to provide guidance, and you're all very close to having working code, though some of your features aren't working.
  - Deploy it!
    - Follow the guide above to deploy your own application. You can blow up any test droplets you create and make new ones.
  - Modify your code locally and then deploy the changes.
    - Either add a feature or clean up some of your working code.
    - Deploy the change!
      - Be sure to carefully break down the process of deploying code. There are a few steps involved.
