#Functions

> We use functions to encapsulate behavior. Functions can take arguments or none at all.

> Functions can return values. We can assign the return value of a function to a variable.

> Write two assertions for all of these.

###ReturnAString
- write a function `logAString`, that simply logs the word "hello" to the console.

- now modify the function so that it takes a single argument and logs that argument to the console.

- write a function `returnAString` that logs a string to the console and RETURNS the same string.
  - assign the result of invoking that function to a variable. Uppercase that.
- now modify the function so that it takes a string as an argument, logs the string, and RETURNS it.

###OddEven

- write a function `oddEven` that takes a single number as an argument and returns true if the number is even and false if odd.

- write a second function `oddEvenAdder` that takes two numbers as arguments and returns true if their sum is even and false if their sum is odd.

###stringTogether

- write a function, stringTogether, that takes an array of strings as an argument, and returns one long string of all the array elements combined

- write a function, stringTogetherLong, that takes an array of strings and returns one long string consisting of only words with 4 or more letters.
