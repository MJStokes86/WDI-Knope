# Choose Your Own Adventure

## Prompt

Today, you are tasked with coming up with a fun command line app that uses an API. Pretty open-ended here.

## Requirements

1. You must develop a detailed feature spec. For example:

  User can see the latest headline from the NYTimes.

  ```bash
  $ node app.js top-headline
  California Imposes First Ever Water Restrictions to Deal with Drought
  http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/02/us/california-imposes-first-ever-water-restrictions-to-deal-with-drought.html
  ```
2. Your app must use an API, ie it must source data from a 3rd party program. You can research and find APIs at [mashape](https://www.mashape.com/explore) or the [programmable web](http://www.programmableweb.com/).

## Bonus

Only attempt this after you have completed the features in your spec!

If your app happens to have data that it is saving to a JSON file, consider using [Redis](http://redis.io/) instead. Use this as an opportunity to explore a new technology. Why would you use Redis? What advantages and disadvantages does it afford? And, try to use it!
