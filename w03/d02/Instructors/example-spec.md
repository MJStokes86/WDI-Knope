# Example Spec

Your spec should be formatted as follows:

1. A user can RSVP to a meetup.
```bash
RSVP jeff jeff@jeff.com
Thank you for RSVPing!
```

You can assume that before the first command you have already telnetted, and that after the server responds the connection is terminated.

Also, the example I put above isn't necessarily the 'best' for that feature; it's just an example.
